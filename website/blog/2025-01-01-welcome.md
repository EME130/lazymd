Introducing lazy-md — a fast, terminal-based markdown editor written in Zig with vim keybindings, live preview, and zero dependencies.

lazy-md is built for developers who live in the terminal. If you use vim, tmux, and the command line every day, lazy-md fits right into your workflow. It features a 3-panel TUI layout inspired by lazygit, syntax highlighting for 16+ languages, 62 built-in plugins, and an MCP server that lets AI agents like Claude Code and Gemini CLI interact with your markdown documents.

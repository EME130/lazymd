# Mouse Support

lazy-md supports mouse input in terminal emulators that support SGR extended mouse mode (most modern terminals):

- **Left click** — Position cursor in the editor, or switch focus to clicked panel
- **Scroll wheel** — Scroll the editor content up/down (3 lines per scroll)

Mouse support is automatically enabled when the editor starts and disabled when it exits.

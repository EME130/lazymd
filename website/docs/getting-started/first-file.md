# Your First File

lazy-md supports standard Markdown (`.md`) and the custom `.rndm` format (which is 100% compatible with Markdown).

The editor opens with a three-panel layout:

- **Left panel** — File tree showing the current directory
- **Center panel** — Editor with vim-like modal editing
- **Right panel** — Live rendered preview of your markdown

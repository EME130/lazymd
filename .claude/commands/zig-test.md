Run `zig build test` and analyze the results. If tests fail:

1. Show which tests failed with their error messages
2. Read the relevant source files to understand the failures
3. Suggest fixes for each failing test
4. If the fix is straightforward, apply it and re-run tests to confirm

If all tests pass, report a summary of test count and any warnings.

Optional argument: $ARGUMENTS (specific test filter or file to focus on)
